<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<h3>Short Version</h3>
<p>
	We try to handle moderation ASAP, but we may not see reports for several
	hours. We will get to all reports though!
</p>

<p>
	We're not a free speech absolutist, and there are instances available for
	that. We're not interested in Nazis, TERFS, or hate speech of any sort,
	which we will define at our sole discretion as moderators. No homophobia,
	transphobia, queerphobia, racism allowed.
</p>

<p>
	This instance is meant to be a friendly, welcoming space to all who are
	willing to reciprocate in helping to create that environment.
</p>

<h3 id="content-warnings-and-sensitive-media">
	Content Warnings and Sensitive Media
</h3>

<p>
	Our Content Warning (CW) policy is intended to make our server comfortable
	for our community. We are not trying to silence our community or police
	discussion, but ask that you consider those who may read your posts when
	making them.
</p>

<p>
	Content Warnings are a feature of Mastodon that enable you to hide the body
	of a "toot" (post) behind a line of text. The intended use of this feature
	is to provide a way to discuss sensitive and/or potentially harmful topics
	without causing duress or harm to anyone who might stumble upon it, though
	content warnings may be used for a wide variety of reasons.
</p>

<p>
	Images can be marked as sensitive. This is a feature which hides an image
	until a warning banner is clicked. Images may be marked as sensitive
	separately from Content Warnings, though using a Content Warning
	automatically marks the toot's images as sensitive.
</p>

<p>
	We cannot enforce content warnings on users from other instances, but can
	help to manage content that you see when reported to instance moderators.
</p>

<p>
	Please be clear and accurate when labeling content warnings, to ensure that
	they follow both the letter and spirit of the enforcements that we have.
</p>

<p>
	Above all, try to be polite, and come from a place of mutual respect when
	discussing content warnings with other. We do not condone tone policing, and
	want to promote healthy discussion in our community.
</p>

<p>
	This cannot ever be a complete list, and so we want to keep it semi-general,
	and reserve the right to use the judgement of the moderation team to make
	decisions in the future.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Enforced Content Warnings:
		<ul>
			<li>
				NSFW/sexual discussion and imagery must be behind descriptive
				CWs (nudity, sex, kink discussion, etc)
			</li>
			<li>
				Triggering topics (direct discussion of rape, trauma, abuse,
				suicide, transphobia, homophobia, etc). The intention is to
				provide a warning for users who may not want to consume this
				content, not to silence users who are sharing their negative
				experiences.
			</li>
			<li>
				Sensitive imagery (please use your best judgement on what
				content that most other users would find sensitive, such as
				photos of surgeries, abuse, war, deceased individuals, etc)
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		Suggested Content Warnings:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Discussion of overtly political (relating to elected or
				unelected government officials) topics
			</li>
			<li>Drugs or drug use</li>
			<li>Advertisements for corporations</li>
			<li>"Rage" posts and posts using mainly capital letters</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		Suggested Sensitive Image Marking
		<ul>
			<li>Eye contact images</li>
			<li>Food related images</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>CryptoCurrency/NFTs</h3>
<p>
	We do not allow the promotion, advertisement, or sale of cryptocurrencies on
	our instance. Mentioning the existence of cryptocurrencies, linking personal
	accounts or addresses, and otherwise discussing them in a way that is not
	intended to sell or advertise a specific cryptocurrency is acceptable. We do
	not have any association with any cryptocurrency or other monetary
	transactions that happen within the server.
</p>

<p>
	We do not allow the promotion, advertisement, or sale of NFTs on our
	instance. We do not allow content from our instance, including content and
	media uploaded by our community members, to be sold as NFTs.
