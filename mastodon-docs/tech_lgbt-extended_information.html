<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<h3>Short Version</h3>
<p>We try to handle moderation ASAP, but we may not see reports for several hours. We will get to all reports though!</p>

<p>This instance is meant to be a friendly, welcoming space to all who are willing to reciprocate in helping to create that environment.</p>
