<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<h3>Short Version</h3>
<p>
	We try to handle moderation ASAP, but we may not see reports for several
	hours. We will get to all reports though!
</p>

<p>
	We're not a free speech absolutist, and there are instances available for
	that. We're not interested in Nazis, TERFS, or hate speech of any sort,
	which we will define at our sole discretion as moderators. No homophobia,
	transphobia, queerphobia, racism allowed.
</p>

<p>
	This instance is meant to be a friendly, welcoming space to all who are
	willing to reciprocate in helping to create that environment.
</p>

<h4 id="content-warnings-and-sensitive-images">
	Content Warnings and Sensitive Images
</h4>

<p>
	Content Warnings (CWs) are a feature of Mastodon that enable you to hide the
	body of a "toot" (post) behind a line of text. The intended use of this
	feature is to provide a way to discuss sensitive and/or potentially harmful
	topics without causing duress or harm to anyone who might stumble upon it,
	though it may be used for many other things.
</p>

<p>
	Images can be marked as sensitive; this is a feature which hides an image
	until a warning banner is clicked. Images may be marked as sensitive
	separately from Content Warnings, though using a Content Warning
	automatically marks the toot's images as sensitive.
</p>

<p>
	Clearly communicated and accurately labeled content warnings and sensitive
	image settings are required when having public conversations involving any
	of the following topics or content:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sexual or Adult content</li>
	<li>
		Detailed descriptions of harassment as outlined above in the definitions
		of harassment
	</li>
	<li>Political Commentary of any kind</li>
	<li>Drugs or Drug Use</li>
	<li>Advertisements for Corporations</li>
	<li>"Rage" toots and Toots using exclusively capital letters</li>
	<li>Excessively Long Toots (longer than ~15-20 lines)</li>
</ul>
