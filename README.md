# Experiments on the web
This repo is a github.io hosted site with some random experiments that I've made and want to show off.

## plush.dog

The root site in this repo is a site for my fursona, BowieBarks. Mainly to show off commissioned artwork that I've gotten from lovely and talented artists. The site is a work in progress.

I specifically tried to make JavaScript-like interactions with only HTML and CSS. This includes a masonry gallery, gallery filters, and a lightbox.

## Pride Flags

I wanted to show how you can use CSS backgrounds and pseudo classes to do fun design on single elements. This is a collection of Pride flags, and I can add more as suggested.

## Mastodon Docs

A collection of documentation for things like Terms of Service and Code of Conduct for my two Mastodon instances, [tech.lgbt](https://tech.lgbt/) and [puppy.cafe](https://puppy.cafe/)
