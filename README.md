# Experiments on the web
This repo is a github.io hosted site with some random experiments that I've made and want to show off.

## bowie.barks.cafe

The root site in this repo is a site for my fursona, BowieBarks. Mainly to show off commissioned artwork that I've gotten from lovely and talented artists. The site is a work in progress.

I specifically tried to make JavaScript-like interactions with only HTML and CSS. This includes a masonry gallery, gallery filters, and a lightbox.

## Concepts
I'm calling little things that I make to play with web code, "concepts".

Here's some of the different concepts that I've come up with:

- [Trans colored button inspired by "Boo, Bitch"](https://bowie.barks.cafe/concepts/trans-button.html)

## Pride Flags

I wanted to show how you can use CSS backgrounds and pseudo classes to do fun design on single elements. This is a collection of Pride flags, and I can add more as suggested.
